# SHRIFT Translation

#### Style Guide:
For regular textboxes, max of 50 characters to a line (They can hold 51, but we want a tiny bit of extra space.)

#### Compendium Entries:
Keep lines to 50 characters long, and no more then 6 lines per entire entry. They may be split up into several "parts" in the translation files, you should double check that everything is okay in-game.

#### Ellipses:
If a passage starts with ellipses, have no space, like this:
>_**"...Yeah."**_

#### Stuttering:
If a character is feared or stressed, use hyphens: (No spaces between stutter characters....)
>_**"T-t-thanks..."**_

Otherwise, use ellipses:
>_**I su... suppose that's okay.**_

#### No Portrait Textboxes:
Use square brackets. Align them to the first letter of text for multiple lines:
>_**Researcher: [Lorem Ipsum]**_

>_**XXXX: 「Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur
        adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor.」**_
