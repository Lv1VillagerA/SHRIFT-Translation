# SHRIFT Translation

Style Guide:
For regular textboxes, max of 50 characters to a line (They can hold 51, but we want a tiny bit of extra space.)

Ellipses:
If a passage starts with ellipses, have no space, like this:
...Yeah.

Stuttering:
No spaces between stutter characters....
T-thanks...

No Portrait Textboxes:
For one line of text, use square brackets:

Researcher: [Lorem Ipsum]

For multiple lines, use one space angle brackets, aligned to first letters:
(word wrap makes this look weird...)
XXXX: 「Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur
        adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor.」
