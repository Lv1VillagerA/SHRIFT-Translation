Oliver (random string) cummed inside the barghest...
Ah...!!Ah...! No! I can't...!! Hold it in...! Nggh!
You... damn thing...!!
The barghest enters a Combat Stance...!
The moment I came, I felt both regret and exhaustion. It might be called a demon, but I got raped by a dog, and came in its vagina...
Woof...
Waafuu 
But that wasn't enough to satisfy her...
U, whaah...! Ah! Ah!! Sto-!!Stop it!!
As if to say, "More!", she starts to shake her hips even more vigorously in arousal.
Stop! Stop it!! I c-, can't cum anymore!! I can't...!
But in contrast to me saying "stop", my manhood inside her swells up again, pulsing as if trying to meet her expectations.
My brain's trying its best to come to grips with the pleasure, and the regret and anxiety I felt before fades away.
Ah...! Ooh...! Hyah...!
The barghest looks aroused and rolls on her back, showing her belly and wagging her tail
Ah...! Ah...!! AAAH ...!! S- so good...♡
Woof ♡ Woof ♡ Woof ♡ 
Ah... hyah... That feels amazing...
M- more...! Moooore...!
Awooh ♡ Awooh ♡
A- aoown ♡ aaooown ♡ AWOOOOOOH ♡
I can't struggle anymore, let alone think normal thoughts. I've turned into a slave who can do nothing but continually pump cum into her as she continues to stimulate me.
But strangely I have no regrets. Or rather, I have no time to think about it, since I can get endless pleasure from her.
From here on, until I die...
When I came to, I was on a strange bed.
My only memory just before waking up was being in a car to go camping. I remember being quite surprised at something.
...? This place... the hell...?
First head for the door on the left-hand corner of this floor. Beyond it will be the security area, then the residential area.
The elevator you're after is in the residential area. The demons' advance was supposed to have been halted before the residential area but...
Considering that barghest that turned up before, I'm guessing it's not safe anymore...
Oliver (random string).

Yuuma「To put it simply, yeah pretty much. But barghests invaded there a little while ago. You'll need to be guided to a safe place.」

Oliver (random string)? I've finished restoring the system. Can you see me on the screen?」

A familiar man was displayed on the screen in front of me. It was definitely my friend Yuuma.

Is this it?
Aa-...!?
Careful. That feeling of being hit with wasabi lasts for a while when you attach it for the first time.
G- gee thanks for the warning!
Is this thing okay to wear!? It's stuck to my ear... it's not dangerous or anything is it...!?
Take it easy, it's fine. You can peel it off with your hand just like a magnet.
It was developed around the beginning of the war with the demons. It's a communication device that picks up the wearer's voice directly from bone vibrations.
My voice is also transmitted directly via your ear bones. Only you can hear it. Or at least that's what's supposed to happen. Apparently demons around you can somehow hear it.
So even though it was widely adopted, the military never utilised it. Still, it's much better than the wireless radio you were using before, right?
Wow... It's like you're right next to me. There's no static or anything...
With this, it won't be like before when I heard your voice and didn't know who it was.
 Please be careful.
... If you can't move from where you are then there's no other way. Understood, I'll give it a try.
I'll be sure to ask you for directions, Yuuma.

Hmm, you let it go. How kind of you. Though it's going to attack you again once it's had time to recover.
Well, you'll understand before long.
...... No mercy, huh. Well, probably for the best considering what's in your future.
The rest of the demons will hold a grudge.
That aside, did you see? Did that demon have any wounds or blood after you shot it?
Now that I think about it... It looked like some kind of spark appeared instead.
A lot's changed in the five years you've been asleep. Today's guns aren't physical tools used to shoot out lead balls.
Ju- just wait a minute!! You only turned up a moment ago and seem to know everything. What the hell are you!?
...You're right, this chat's gone on too long. Well, we'll meet again before long.
 Be sure not to get fucked.
The small black fox disappeared with a pop...
It seems the demons sensed the location of this underground shelter. I'd like to completely isolate and conceal this hospital section but... I think it's just a matter of time.
A certain morning on holiday. I was supposed to go camping with my friend and our girlfriends, four people all up.
It will surely be a nice holiday where mutual relations deepen. Or it was supposed to be...
It was supposed to be...
*excited whine*
......... WOOF!
Wooof ♡
............? Did a door open somewhere...?
*Pant* ...... *Pant* ......... *Pant* ......... *Pant*
Wh- what is that? That creature...! A dog...? No, but that face...
Yuuma「Dog...? That might be a barghest. Oh that's right, you don't even know about the existence of demons.」
Yuuma「Dog...? That might be a barghest. Oh that's right, you don't even know about the existence of demons.」
Barghest...? That thing's a demon...?
Understood. For the time being, I'll get in the communications room so it doesn't notice me.
It leaped on me as soon as I opened the door. That demon earlier referred to as a barghest.
In a quick surprise attack, she knocked me off balance and clambered on top of me.
And worst of all. I accidently threw my gun off somewhere!
Hahhh...! Hahhh...!! Wh- what was that just now?
The abnormality in my body subsided as I steadied my breathing.
But exhaustion quickly followed relief, and these incomprehensible events made me feel like I was on the verge of blacking out again.
A-... Anyway... I need to... move forward.
Urgh...
I can't spot any bullet wounds or injuries from that shock wave I made. One of her hindpaws looks like it got hit though, it's pretty swollen.
*whimper*...
Well, you know, after shooting at you so much, it's a bit weird hearing you make that kind of noise. Haha. 
I'm... I'm sorry... For hurting you.
...Woof ♡
I wonder if it understood I meant no harm? Once again, it tried to get my clothes off as it came up to my face.
Wait a minute!!Wait Wait!! Calm down!!
Listen to me!! There's a good girl!!
Someone's scribblings
There is no combat here in this land anymore. But for men, this place may be harsher than the battlefield.
Though they don't like conflict, female demons are very interested in humans. They prowl all over the place looking for "playmates".
They do not treat us as humans but as food. That is, something only to be milked and eaten.
You can continue to survive as a human as long as you don't pour your semen into them.
The idiots who want to be food for them can do whatever they want. I'll get away even if I have to crawl.
Yuuma「Right, I can hear your voice clearly from in here. Can you hear me?」
Yuuma「Right, I can hear your voice clearly from in here. Can you hear me?」
First of all, what happened to us back then? Weren't we supposed to be heading up the mountain to go camping?
Yuuma「Oh, we were in an accident on the mountain road that day. We were hit by an oncoming car.」
Yuuma「Oh, we were in an accident on the mountain road that day. We were hit by an oncoming car.」
Yuuma「We were seriously injured in that accident... You've been in a coma for a long time.」
Yuuma「We were seriously injured in that accident... You've been in a coma for a long time.」
Coma... How long have I been sleeping?
Yuuma「............It's been five years. You were sleeping for five years.」
Yuuma「............It's been five years. You were sleeping for five years.」
Five whole years!?
Yuuma「Soon after the day of the accident, the world also changed massively. ......... The war with demons began.」
Yuuma「Mankind was dominant at first, but was gradually pushed back. That district was occupied recently by demons.」

Yuuma「I have unconcious patients in critical condition, including you. They were evacuated to the ward area of the underground shelter.」

Yuuma「It was supposed to be set up for long-term cryogenic stasis. The machine you were in must have automatically thawed you out because it detected that you happened to regain conciousness.」
So in other words... I completely missed the evacuation, and now I've woken up alone and stranded here in this zone?
Yuuma「That's the long and short of it... But the barghest invaded a little while ago. We'll need to guide you to a safe place.」
Yuuma「First and foremost, do not mate with them.」
Yuuma「First and foremost, do not mate with them.」
HAH!? The hell are you saying in this kind of situation!!
Yuuma「I'm serious. You're such an easy-going kind of guy. Because they're harmless, you might end up completely at their mercy.」
Yuuma「Besides, you saw it didn't you? That thing's different from a normal dog or cat.」
Yuuma「Also, it'll take a bit of time to get control of this facility's systems.」
Yuuma「Also, it'll take a bit of time to get control of this facility's systems.」

I can't hear anything from the radio.
I can't hear anything from the radio.
What the hell..."demons", "mating"... I still don't understand any of this shit.
For now, let's find some weapons. I think I saw something on that chair a moment ago...
I can't hear anything on the radio. It looks like it's going to take some time to restore the system.

The look on his face was enough to make me forget it'd been five years. The face I knew hadn't changed, and I unconciously felt a sense of safety.

Oh, yeah!! I can hear you, Yuuma!
... I suppose it'd be stupid of me to worry about your physical condition given your situation.
I'm so glad... to hear your voice again. Five years... five years. You had me worried you son of a bitch...!
Yuuma gets choked up while staring at me through the screen. This guy's as sincere as ever.
Heh, five years and you still haven't changed. Though something that's a bit weird are those clothes you're wearing, they're pretty stuffy.
A lot's happened... Believe it or not, but I've now been made captain of a small military group.
You? A captain? Your troops are gonna have a pretty rough time.
Hey don't say that. In fact it's thanks to that that I was able to safely evacuate you there.
... That's right. Securing your safety is now top priorty. Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.
... Okay
That's right, I can't relax just yet. I'm underground in an area rampant with demons, I'm not out of the woods yet.
That's right, I can't relax just yet. I'm underground in an area rampant with demons, I'm not out of the woods yet.
I'm currently on the undersea train platform. The evacuation of residents and troops has finished and the only evacuation train I've obtained is a maintainance locomotive.
I was going to use it to escape by myself, I was actually planning on leaving on pretty soon.
... I really was here just in time.
Pretty much. And I'm sorry but to ensure this place remains secure, I can't come rescue you.
First things first, find a way out of there. If I remember correctly, there should be an elevator that goes above ground in that hospital section. Try looking for that.
W- wait!! Like before... I don't really understand. You want me to go out there alone in a place with demons wandering around?
It's okay, I'll give you directions. If you use the portable communication device that's in this room, I'll be able to use your coordinates to continuously monitor your location.
Yeah... leave it to me.
A gun's been casually left on this chair. It shines like it's never been fired once.
A gun's been casually left on this chair. It shines like it's never been fired once.
Is this what I saw earlier...? Having this will be more reassuring than going around unarmed...
Raaaarr.........
!!! That's the one I saw from before...!
A demon called a barghest. It rushed up to me the moment it noticed me.
It didn't look particularly terrifying. It was wagging its tail and staring intently at me.
Its behaviour and appearance ran contrary to the warnings I'd heard, and I unconciously relaxed my finger on the trigger of my gun.
...... Damn! Cool it...! This thing's a demon, not a dog...!
Haaaaah! Haaaah!!
The lights are on... Has the system been restored?
A Researcher's Scribblings
It seems the demons sensed the location of this underground shelter. I'd like to completely isolate and conceal this hospital section but... I guess it's probably just a matter of time.
Those damn dogs aren't an issue, they don't bother me at all. (Though some guys have literally gotten caught.) The problem is that stupid big monster.
That monster and that brat, they must not learn of the existence of this place. I'm going to the combat zone with the troops, even if only to act as a diversion.
I've got a shotgun now. So to whoever's reading this memo, I leave to you a peashooter I've been keeping as a precious emergency weapon. Yoshihiro
"Watch yourself, keep your eyes open. Your demonic enemies pace about roaring like lions, looking for something to consume."
Nice to meet you, or rather, long time no see? Either way, I should introduce myself.
My name is Meira. I'm the secretary of the main "Hell's Gate".
By the Lord's decree, I've obtained your help. I wonder why there's been direct communication from the Lord at such an opportune time.
So, first of all, would you please tell me your name?
Great. Being able to clearly give me your name in this slumber is surely your strength of determination against fate.
Next, we'll do a basic tutorial. It's exactly the same as the trial version, so you can skip it if you've already done it.
I hear a voice calling your name....... Go on, you mustn't ignore it.......
Uuuh...

Oliver (random string)!!
AAAAH! Stop with the gut punches already!!!
Ah!! You're finally up! I guess that's what it takes...
Oliver (random string).
I mean, Reina. How did you get in my room...?
Are you still half-asleep? We both went to get a duplicate key made last week.
Oh...... that's right.
You don't remember? Hey, is it really okay for me to have this key?
Hmmm... It might not be okay. A certain someone's punched me pretty good.
Oh, ahaha... sorry. It was because you weren't really getting up.
Ah! Anyway! Today's the day you promised to go with Micah and the others isn't it!? How long are you gonna sleep!
Oliver (random string).
With Yuuma and the others...? Was that today?
Ah... well I'm changed into clothes for going out, I prepared myself so I could sleep in...
There's really no time to look at the PC...
I want to check my messages but Yuuma's going to be driving so I might check them in the car.
"Shadow of a demon in M.O.W.! Multiple eyewitness accounts have been collected!!" Is M.O.W. that religious organization...?
Ha ha ha... "Demons" in this era... It's so peaceful that the media can only ever write about this kind of thing...
My kitchen. I can cook the basics. I don't use it that much since Reina brings over meals.
It was beautiful before it got filled with unwashed dishes. I'm not very good at cleaning up after all.
Arf...
This seems to be the bed I was sleeping in. Actually it's more like a capsule if anything.
It seems to have stopped operating.
It's a strange machine. The display says "cryogenic stasis exit complete".
Was I in cryogenic stasis? How the hell...?
The captain completed the evacuation of critical patients to this facility. If the cryogenic stasis procedure for this patient is completed, we will prepare for withdrawal as well.

This man is an acquaintance of the captain, a really important, close friend apparently. Though the captain always gets results on the front lines, I understand the reason behind voluntarily accepting this kind of paperwork duty.

There aren't any particularly dangerous demons, around here. I want to go back home and have a drink. I have so much free time I'm actually writing this kind of note.

...? This memo ends abruptly. Did something happen...?
Is this...... a radio? It looks like it's linked to a PC...
Only one thing for it, let's get this thing online!
With a feeling of desperation, I clicked on the button and got a wireless radio.

Gyaggh!!!
*pant*... *pant*... *pant*...♡ ♡
This is a demon called a barghest. It's breathing heavily and staring intently at me.
Damn...!!
???「Hey now! What's the matter?! You don't wanna shoot it because it looks kinda like a dog?」
What?!? What are you!? Where'd you come from?
What a rude guy you are. I'm a demon too. Where'd I come from? Where ever I feel like coming from.
But don't worry. I'm on your side.
A certain magician blew me over here to help you since you just woke up and all.
...... So, are you just gonna flap around, or are you gonna shoot that gun?
I've never fired a re- real gun before but... Maybe if it's just a model gun like this...
OK, do you know where the safety is? If so, you're pretty much there.
 That's it.
But... That kind of thing is...
Do you mean to say that you can't aim a gun at something that doesn't want to fight?
She only wants to mate with you.
Even if it feels good when you cum, it won't be a nice way to go out.
Just shoot it!! It's okay, as if you'd really hurt a demon with a gun!!

USELESS!!! Where the hell were you shooting you fool!!
I- I can't help it!! I can barely make it out in this darkness!!
Ah rats... it's been spooked away.
This... is bad. I've completely lost sight of it.
Right, there's nothing for it.
take off your clothes.
WHAT!?
wants to copulate with you.
what happens if you get naked? It'll definitely think you're in the mood.
taking off your clothes and letting down your guard is a useful strategy.
Now get naked!!! Hurry up and do it!!! Don't dawdle!! Get naked with all your heart!!
What're you saying!!?
Woof ♡ ♡
Hey!!! What's wrong?! That's a good target! Quickly! Shoot!!
Y- yeah but...
, is that it?
I-, idiot!! Stop saying weird stuff!! I really can't shoot something that isn't fighting back!
I mean stop saying such weird stuff...! Like I'd be interested in that thing...!!
.
you can jump her bones with the "submit" command.
What it means to submit to your opponent?
Since I'm here with you this time, let's not have any submitting. I'll have you attack her.
I've averted the danger of my sanity being eroded for now. But it's not like this situation is much of an improvement.
I can't afford to use all my strength in this situation! But... I don't know what to do...
Woooh...
Both me and the barghest recoiling in front of me were surprised by this strange situation.
What...What is this...! Ugh...... Urgh...... Ggh...!!
An uncontrollable force filled the palm of my hand, I surrendered to the impulse, holding my hands up in front of me.
Dammit...! This thing...!!
And though I was flustered, I foolishly met her gaze.
Before I could think it through. My hands were peeling off my clothes.
It's scary to think about now... I didn't have the slightest concern about my strange behaviour.
*pant* ♡ *pant* ♡
Whaa...♡ Ohh... Ohhhh...
Looking down at me in triumph, she eagerly awaits the moment I give in to the pleasure.
... Whoops, were you in the middle of something?
Oh...ahhhh...♡ H-...help...
Sorry but I don't have a physical form. There's no way for me to rescue you.
.
………Hmm? But hang on, didn't someone already explain the struggle skill to you...?
Could you stay focused!!
... Oh, fair enough.
Well I'm gonna head back. Survive this using that "struggle" command you learned about before.
have to kick her off on the next turn, or you're gonna get raped.
Now then, I'll start the tutorial.

Though worst case, you will not die even if they're reduced to zero.
You will ejaculate.
.
you will not be able to move for a while.
.
, which you need in order to take actions.
 has also decreased?

 For example, when being pushed down by an opponent.
Well, next I will explain the "Struggle" skill. This will be hard to understand if there's no opponent to fight ....
Hey hey! I'll do it for you.
That's a good offer... Just make sure you follow my instructions, this is a tutorial after all.
 all sorts of reasons.
Your opponents are entities with inhuman powers... You cannot survive unless you choose the right "struggle".
There are 4 "struggle" skills in all. They can be broadly classified into two different types.
doesn't depend on what body part has been bound by your opponent.
you cannot use them if your hands and feet are both bound.
What's the big deal? You were going to explain what happens after I do this anyway weren't you?
Your feet are now bound.
Try using the appropriate "struggle" skill.
 without issue.
.
 So if you have 50 left, it will recover 50.
 It's there as an option if you can't use items or Deep Breathing.
 in the Actions menu.
Aw, he got away...♡
Well then, how about THIS?
......... Lampas, you're going a bit far.
But that lot outside are sooo gonna attack him like this, right?
Even if it's just so no one but me gets to eat him, I think he needs this kind of practice. ♡
......There's nothing for it I suppose. Then please try to find your way out of this situation using the "struggle" skill.
Lampas' ivy sucking is decreasing your Willpower in real time.
Oooh, lucky for you I wasn't able to kiss you too much.
Ahaha, that was a real treat, I got lots of kisses.
Well then, I'm gonna head home.... I'll play with you more next time we meet. ♡
Good grief...... Anyway, you seem to have been able to master the "struggle" skills successfully.
This concludes the tutorial.... No wait, I forgot to tell you another important thing.
100 (random string) Ecstasy" bad status. It's probably because you inhaled that Lampas pollen from just before.
100 (random string) Ecstasy levels can stack up. Its effects get worse as it stacks, it's a very dangerous bad status.
You need to treat it with an item or by using an "Action" before its too late.
100 (random string)Face Punch", please deal with your Ecstasy status.
Good work. I didn't expect that to happen in this tutorial, but with that you've learnt from your opponent how to deal with bad status effects.
will each use their own bind and bad status attacks in a variety of ways.
Sometimes, as if to ridicule your struggle they will relentlessly stack bad status effects and try to corner you.
Their objective is for you to give up your resistance to them. 
So between attacks, there are precious few moments for struggling and recovery.
but above all make sure you don't throw away your "Determination to fight"......
Ah...!! ♡ AHHHH...!!! ♡ That feels amazing...♡
